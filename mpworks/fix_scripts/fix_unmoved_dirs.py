"""
The purpose of this script is to detect whether any directories were only partially moved from $SCRATCH dirs to $GARDEN due to a disk space error.
If it detects a directory that is in BOTH $SCRATCH and $GARDEN, it prints it.

Currently it is up to the user to manually move directories (for safety)
